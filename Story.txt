	The net of music stores offers diferent types of records: vynil records, CDs and DVDs/BLU-RAYs. Each record has it's properties like the name of the record, genre, artist, year of publishing and label. There are some special properties: for vinyl records it is weight and for DVDs it is video format. Each shop has its own storage of records. Also some of the records can be not in any of the stores, but can be ordered. That means that the customer should see the amount of copies of each record that is currently on sale in particular store and records that are available for the ordering.
	There are several stores in the net (each one has its own adress). And there are employees in each store. We want to store information about name, date of birth and salary of each employee. An employee can work only in one store, but store can have many employees. Some of the employees are managers of the local stores. Each store can have only one manager, and employee can manage only one store.
	We want to have an information about every customer that bought something in the net of stores. We want to know the name of the customer, date of purchase, what did he buy (or ordered) and in which shop.
	The staff of the shops should be able to see all purchases and orders that were made in stores, so that they can get an information about the profit of the company.
	Some of the customers have discount cards. The information needed for the cardholder is his name, address, amount of money spent on purchases, his date of birth and e-mail. The discount system in a company works like following - if a customer spends certain amount of money (500 CZK) at one purchase, he receives a standart discount card (5% discount). There are three different types of disount cards. The discount is determined by the amount of money spent by the cardholder: if the sum of all purchases is more than 5000 CZK, the customer receives 15% discount, and if the sum is more than 10000 CZK, he receives 20% discount.
